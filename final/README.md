This is a music gotcha machine to help users select music. While people want to play music in daily life, sometimes they donâ€™t know what to listen to. So I want to make a fun music selector to help them make the decision. The way this device works is, everytime it rotates will drop a ball off. When the ball rolls to the hole, the computer will play a music.
