This is a music gotcha machine to help users select music. While people want to play music in daily life, sometimes they donâ€™t know what to listen to. So I want to make a fun music selector to help them make the decision. The way this device works is, everytime it rotates will drop a ball off. When the ball rolls to the hole, the computer will play a music. The initial idea is designing the machine connected to a website. The user will play the sound by inputing the number written on the ball to the website. While I was working on the progress, I found out there are too many unneccesary steps in this way, so I get rid of the website part, enabling user to play music as long as they make the machine rotate.
